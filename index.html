        <h2>Have you heard of the cult of Zoltan? They're a group of people who worship a bearded man named Zoltan and believe he has the power to grant wishes. But be warned, Zoltan is a bit of a prankster. One time, a member of the cult wished for a lifetime supply of donuts, but Zoltan granted their wish by filling their house with inflatable donuts! Another member wished for a million dollars, but Zoltan gave them Monopoly money instead. Despite these shenanigans, the cult of Zoltan remains devoted to their beloved leader. Who knows, maybe one day Zoltan will finally grant their true desires... or maybe he'll just turn their hair green for a good laugh.</h2>
